This library is under development, and is not yet complete.

It is designed as a C/C++ library to provide an interface to INDI, with pluggable GUI toolkits

Currently there are 2 GUI toolkits supported:

* wxWidgets
* gtk

Build relies on CMake:

cmake .
make

* openPHD
	http://code.google.com/p/open-phd-guiding/
	see *_INDI.cpp

* gcx
	http://gcx.sourceforge.net/
	see *_indi.c

Interface
---------
before starting, one must 1st call indi_init() which will return a pointer to :e
	struct indi_t indi = indi_init(hostname, port);
