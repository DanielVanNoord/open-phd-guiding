Notes for MSVC/Windows users:

The CMake routines that automatically find the cfitsio and zlib libraries
don't work well under Windows, partially because there is no "standard"
place to install them.  I installed both of them in directories that are
siblings of the phd directory, and then ran cmake with:

cmake -D CFITSIO_INCLUDE_DIR=../cfitsio -D CFITSIO_LIBRARIES=../cfitsio/cfitsio -D ZLIB_INCLUDE_DIR=../zlib/include -D ZLIB_LIBRARY=../zlib/lib/ .

This isn't very pretty, but it works
