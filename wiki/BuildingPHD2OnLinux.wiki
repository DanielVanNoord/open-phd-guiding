#summary Building PHD2 on Linux

= Instructions for building PHD2 on Linux =

 * install dependencies (commands for a Fedora-like system; your system may vary)
{{{
sudo yum install subversion gtk2-devel cfitsio-devel opencv-devel
}}}

 * download and install wxWidgets 2.9.5 or later. Right now the latest is 3.0.0rc2, and that works fine.
{{{
cd wxWidgets-3.0.0-rc2
mkdir build
cd build
../configure --with-libpng=builtin --with-regex=builtin --with-libjpeg=builtin --with-libtiff=builtin --with-expat=builtin --disable-shared
make
sudo make install
}}}

  * get the phd2 sources
{{{
svn checkout http://open-phd-guiding.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ open-phd-guiding
}}}

  * build phd2
{{{
cd open-phd-guiding
make
}}}

  * run phd2
{{{
./phd2
}}}
