#summary Building PHD2 on Linux

= Instructions for building PHD2 on Linux =

== Build Dependencies ==
=== Fedora-like systems ===

 * install dependencies (commands for a Fedora-like system; your system may vary)
{{{
sudo yum install subversion gtk2-devel cfitsio-devel opencv-devel libusb1-devel
}}}

=== Ubuntu ===

 * install dependencies (tested on 13.10)
{{{
sudo apt-get install build-essential libgtk2.0-dev libcfitsio3-dev libopencv-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev subversion

 * download and extract wxWidgets 3.0.0 or later from http://wxwidgets.org
{{{
# cd into the extracted wx 
cd wxWidgets-3.0.0/

# change files to have unix newlines, this is needed for at least all python and shell scripts
find . -type f -print -exec perl -p -i -e "s/\r\n/\n/" {} \;

cd build/
../configure --with-libpng=builtin --with-regex=builtin --with-libjpeg=builtin --with-libtiff=builtin --with-expat=builtin --disable-shared
make
sudo make install
}}}

If you prefer not to install this wxWidgets build on your system, and just use it for building PHD2, add the following to option to configure:

{{{--prefix=WXDIR}}}

replacing {{{WXDIR}}} with a location of your choice. Then, add {{{WXDIR/bin}}} to your PATH before building PHD2 as described below.

{{{
svn checkout http://open-phd-guiding.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ open-phd-guiding
}}}
