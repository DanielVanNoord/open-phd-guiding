   In Ubuntu this is a package like:
     * libwxgtk2.8-dev

libcftsio libraries and headers installed

Support for Video4Linux devices is built-in now and requires (Debian/Ubuntu package names given)
	* libudev-dev (for device detection)
	* libv4l-dev

Some more libraries:
       * zlib1g-dev 
       * libfitsio3-dev (libcfitsio3-dev on debian)

cmake .
make
make install

If you want to install to a different directory, run e.g.
